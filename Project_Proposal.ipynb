    "## General Description:\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to effectively detect phishing websites through URL analysis. Utilizing the Gradient Boosting Classifier, the project will focus on differentiating between legitimate and phishing URLs by analyzing their distinct characteristics. This includes examining the linguistic and aesthetic features of URLs commonly employed in phishing attacks. The project will leverage a dataset comprising both phishing and legitimate URLs to train and test the model, ensuring a robust and accurate classification system.\n"

    "## Motivation:\n",
    "In recent years, advancements in Internet and cloud technologies have led to a significant increase in electronic trading in which consumers make online purchases and transactions. This growth leads to unauthorized access to users’ sensitive information and damages the resources of an enterprise. Phishing is one of the familiar attacks that trick users to access malicious content and gain their information. In terms of website interface and uniform resource locator (URL), most phishing webpages look identical to the actual webpages. Various strategies for detecting phishing websites, such as blacklist, heuristic, Etc., have been suggested. However, due to inefficient security technologies, there is an exponential increase in the number of victims. The anonymous and uncontrollable framework of the Internet is more vulnerable to phishing attacks. Existing research works show that the performance of the phishing detection system is limited. There is a demand for an intelligent technique to protect users from the cyber-attacks.These attacks not only compromise personal data but also pose significant risks to online financial activities. The motivation behind this project is to advance cybersecurity measures by incorporating machine learning techniques in the detection of phishing URLs. The project is driven by the need to improve online safety and to keep pace with the rapidly evolving phishing tactics. By successfully identifying and flagging phishing URLs, the project will contribute to safeguarding user data and enhancing trust in digital communications.\n"
