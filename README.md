TITLE: 
DETECTION OF PHISHING WEBSITE USING MACHINE LEARNING MODEL BASED ON URL ANALYSIS.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to effectively detect phishing websites through URL analysis. Utilizing the Gradient Boosting Classifier, the project will focus on differentiating between legitimate and phishing URLs by analyzing their distinct characteristics. This includes examining the linguistic and aesthetic features of URLs commonly employed in phishing attacks. The project will leverage a dataset comprising both phishing and legitimate URLs to train and test the model, ensuring a robust and accurate classification system.


MOTIVATION:
Phishing attacks have become a prevalent threat in the digital world, targeting unsuspecting individuals and organizations. These attacks not only compromise personal data but also pose significant risks to online financial activities. The motivation behind this project is to advance cybersecurity measures by incorporating machine learning techniques in the detection of phishing URLs. The project is driven by the need to improve online safety and to keep pace with the rapidly evolving phishing tactics. By successfully identifying and flagging phishing URLs, the project will contribute to safeguarding user data and enhancing trust in digital communications.


TIMELINE AND MILESTONES(WEEKLY):
 Week 1: Selection of Project Topic.
 Week 2: Project Proposal and Confirmation.
 Week 3: Review of literature, and existing anti-phishing methods.
 Week 4: Data collection – assembling a dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs.
 Week 5-6: Data preprocessing and initial feature extraction.
 Week 7-8: Development and training of the Gradient Boosting Classifier model.
 Week 9: Model testing and performance evaluation.
 Week 10: Creation of browser extension or developing a GUI which takes the URL and predicts its nature i.e., legitimate of phishing.
 Week 11: Final evaluation, documentation. 
 Week 12: Final Presentation.


EXPECTED OUTCOME:
The primary outcome of this project is the development of a highly accurate machine learning model capable of real-time identification of phishing URLs. The expected deliverables include:
•	A fully functional Gradient Boosting Classifier model.
•	Comprehensive documentation detailing the model development process, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model tuning techniques.
•	A working GUI to predict the nature of Phishing Websites i, e. legitimate or illegal(phishing).
•	A final report showcasing the model's accuracy, precision in distinguishing between phishing and legitimate URLs.
•	Recommendations for future enhancements and potential applications in various cybersecurity domains.
The success of this project will be measured by the model’s accuracy and efficiency in detecting phishing URLs, contributing significantly to the field of cybersecurity and online safety.
