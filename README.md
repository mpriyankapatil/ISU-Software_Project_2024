TITLE: 
DETECTION OF PHISHING WEBSITE USING MACHINE LEARNING MODEL BASED ON URL ANALYSIS.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to effectively detect phishing websites through URL analysis. Utilizing the Gradient Boosting Classifier, the project will focus on differentiating between legitimate and phishing URLs by analyzing their distinct characteristics. This includes examining the linguistic and aesthetic features of URLs commonly employed in phishing attacks. The project will leverage a dataset comprising both phishing and legitimate URLs to train and test the model, ensuring a robust and accurate classification system.
